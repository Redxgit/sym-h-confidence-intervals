## Authors
### Armando Collado-Villaverde, Pablo Mu√±oz and Consuelo Cid

This repository contains the predictions made by the model in the Operational SYM-H forecasting with confidence intervals using Deep Neural Networks paper on the test and test key storms and using the model in https://doi.org/10.1029/2023SW003485 as comparison.

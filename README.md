## Authors
### Armando Collado-Villaverde, Pablo Mu√±oz and Consuelo Cid

This repository contains the predictions made by the model in the Operational SYM-H forecasting with confidence intervals using Deep Neural Networks paper on the test and test key storms and using the model in https://doi.org/10.1029/2023SW003485 as comparison.

## DNN hyperparams

![DNN sketch](arch_q_alpha.png "DNN sketch")

Input timesteps: 48 of 5 minutes averages.
Output: SYM-H forecast at the next 1 or 2 hours and the 5% and 95% Quantile forecasts.
Same hyperparams are used for the 1 and 2 hours models.

Forecasted SYM-H ouput layer trained with MSE and the quantile layers with the Quantile loss in the `quantile_loss.py` file setting `q` at 0.05 and 0.95.

Trained with the AdaBelief optimizer (https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/optimizers/AdaBelief) on TensorFlow 2.14
